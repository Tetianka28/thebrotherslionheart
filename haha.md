Prompt

Step 1: 

forward / backward button (similar to next/back on carousel) : located on each side
There is 3 stages. For each click the background needs to fade/fade out standard transition ( no ease-in-out )
The images is located in the Hero section

Step 2:
Have hero-text field, change based on what image is visible : meaning, use the id of the image to to attach the correct text for it. 
Possibly use array of objects to control it. Each object contains the info about each "section". This box needs to be faded in/out individually. x 

Step 3: 
Final step is having a a image ( with three "sprites" in it). Meaning, one image that have three "persons" in it. So each person takes up 120 degrees, and rotates on the center (0, 0). Once the button is clicked, and the background image + text changes - the image rotate, so the correct person "spins" in.
